I am a Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend development, working primarily with Java and Python to build reliable, scalable, and well-structured systems. Driven by continuous learning and practical problem-solving, I value clean code, solid software architecture, and best practices, and I approach every project as an opportunity to strengthen my skills and deliver real-world solutions through technology.
